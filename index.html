# Musical Figure.

This video sets the data in the above figure to pitches. One increase in percentage point equals one chromatic step (well, almost, the piano midi ran out of notes after about 80 percentage points). There are four layers:

- Layer one, heard from 0:00: just that general sense of "Covid Normal" dread.

- Layer two, heard from 0:18: The grey line, number of new cases.

- Layer three, heard from 0:42: The black line, number of new deaths.

- Layer four, heard from 2:13: The red line, number of DataCreatives teams site views.
